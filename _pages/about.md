I am Arun Sakthi Anand, a senior year Electrical Engineering Undergraduate at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/).

I'm an avid coder skilled in C, C++, Python, Java and expirienced in Android app Dev, Web Dev, Ardunio Programming and Machine Learning. I am passionate about technology and I love solving puzzles.

I am currently working on a full stack project to develope a web application to handle the requirements of the postal office in IIT Hyderabad.

At my leisure, I love to play field hockey, watch football, listen to music(can sing too!) and play chess.

I am looking for opportunities to work in the tech industry as a Software Developer. Please contact me if you find my [profile]() interesting.
