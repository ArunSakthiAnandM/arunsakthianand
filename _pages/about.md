I am Arun Sakthi Anand, a senior year Electrical Engineering Undergraduate at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/).

I'm an avid coder skilled in C, C++, Python, Java and expirienced in Android app Dev, Web Dev, Ardunio Programming and Machine Learning. I am passionate about technology and I love solving puzzles. This passion has driven me into becoming a **self-taught coder** with good contributions towards open-source. I love solving problems from websites like LeetCode, CodeChef etc. I like sharing my knowledge with everyone, so I'm currently working on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ArunSakthiAnandM/Basic_Algorithms) that contains some of the most basic algorithms that I've learnt over the past years and another [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ArunSakthiAnandM/LeetCode_Solutions) with solutions to some of the most common Coding Questions.

I am an excellent listener and an efficient communicator. It is always easy for me to adjust and adapt to my surroundings. I have proved myself as a person who possesses excellent leadership and decision making skills when I was serving as the President of the Students' Gymkhana at IIT Hyderabad from May 2021 till April 2022.

I am currently working on a full stack project to develope a web application to handle the requirements of the postal office in IIT Hyderabad.

At my leisure, I love to play field hockey, watch football, listen to music(can sing too!) and play chess.

I am looking for opportunities to work in the tech industry as a Software Developer. Please contact me if you find my **[profile](https://arunsakthianandm.github.io/cv/)** interesting.
