In this project, we built a calculator from scratch(including 3-D printing of the case) which is controlled by ATmega328 microcontroller. The controller receives the input from a 4×5 Matrix Array 20 Key Membrane Switch Keypad Keyboard.

The motive of this project is to use the [ATmega328](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega328) (without the complete Arduino UNO board) to implement the functions of a basic calculator. The computations are accurate until either of the inputs or the output doesn't exceed 2,147,483,647 or fall behind -2,147,483,648(size of long in C)
