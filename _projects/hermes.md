In this project, we built an Adroid Chat Application exclusive to IITH users that allows users to create communities. Anyone from IITH can Create and Join the communities of their intrest to interact with like minded people.

The app was built in JAVA with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as backend. The motive was to make sure that anyone who is new to the campus will be able to get together with like-minded peers with ease.
